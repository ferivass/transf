We can use the PPE STANDBY database to create the transportable tablespace.

In a READ only database (as Standby is) you cannot create Transportable tablespace set as you have to
run a EXPDP (oracle utility) to export the Tablespace metadata and this EXPDP must create a master table
in database which is imposible in a READ ONLY database.

However, we may convert the STANDBY database to a SNAPSHOT database which can then open READ WRITE
After we done we may revert the SNAPSHOT database as it was , a STANDBY database.

While in SNAPHOT database you cannot SWITCHOVER or FAILOVER from PRIMARY in case of failure.
However, we need database in SNAPSHOT mode as long as copy the EMIS_MI tablespace to create 
the Transportable tablespace and then after we can revert the SNAPSHOT databse back to STANDBY. 

1)Make sure Standby is in SYNC with primary
2)Create a snapshot database from Standby database

Now the snapshot database is open read write so we can create a 
TRansportable tablespace from this database.


3)Create the transportable tablespace set from Snapshot database
This means to copy EMIS_MI tablespace and run the EXPDP to export the metadata

4)Revert the snapshot database back to STandby database
5)Standby database will catch up with primary database
6)Transportable tablespace set are available to be attached to a database and such the re-partition begin
